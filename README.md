Standard stuff to get it running: 

git clone: https://github.com/nunayerBeezwax/thermic_whims.git
(if necessary install postgres on your local system -- http://www.postgresql.org/download/)
bundle install
rake db:create db:migrate
rails s
then visit localhost:3000 in your browser

and you will see it in all glory.
